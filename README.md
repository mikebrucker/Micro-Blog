Building a Micro-blogging App - Group
Goal:

To become familiar with building a web aplication using Sinatra

Assignment:

You’ll be building a micro-blogging app in a group of two

Before you start coding

Start out by sketching out your app. How will the user sign-in flow work? How will users create new posts? Who is this platform for? Illustrate and think through all of these processes. Start out on paper or using prototyping software like OmniGraffle, Photoshop, or Illustrator.
Have your plans approved by your instructor before moving forward.
Start a basic repository on GitHub with a README.md file
Open issues to be assigned to each group member for all of the tasks to be done.
Use branches, pull requests, and descriptive commit messages to close each issue once the work is done.
Site Requirements:

A user should be able to

Sign up
Sign in
Sign out
Edit their account details
Delete their account
Post micro-blogs (less than 150 characters)
See a profile page with all of their account details and micro-blog posts to date
Visit other users’ profile pages
See a page with the 10 most recent posts (the “feed”)
Your project should look good, don’t make the front end bare-bones. Feel free to use JavaScript for awesome front end interactions! Good luck, have fun, and learn a lot! You have until the end of class on Friday for class time as well as the weekend if you’d like to make any final tweaks before your project is submitted.

Should have a user model with sign up, in, login, edit, delete functionality
Should have a Post model that allows current user to create posts
A user should be able to perform all CRUD actions on a post
